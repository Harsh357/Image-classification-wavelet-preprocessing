# Image-classification-wavelet-preprocessing
Color images are tough to classify. Greyscaling does help reduce the dimension, however if we are able to project the color image to 2-D image such that the the relevant areas of interest are more dominant, then classification could improve and be resist to noise and artifacts.
Here I use 3-D wavelets to project the color image to 2 dimension. This not only reduces dimention but reduces in a controlled way(can be controlled by chossing different wavelet) which can help train with fewer images, and improve accuracy but may make it slow.
The code works best for medical images(where some small regions are of atmost interest) as the parameters were set for it. While using the code please add the path to the training and testing dataset. The code will also be good for classification of images based on textures.
