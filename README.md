# Image-classification-wavelet-preprocessing
Color images are tough to classify. Greyscaling does help reduce the dimension, however if we are able to project the color image to 2-D image such that the the relevant areas of interest are more dominant than classification could improve and resistant to noise artifacts.Here I use 3-D wavelets to project to the 2 dimension.
